                    So how do we actually use our code, now that we have a general
                    understanding of what it looks like? Here's where we get to learn the
                    most exciting part about working with Java: Object Oriented Programming.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Object Oriented Programming, or OOP for short, is a <em> theory </em> for
                    thinking about how code works. At a basic level all code ultimately is, is a list
                    of instructions for a computer to do one step at a time. The computer is really just
                    remembering data for us (variables) and changing them (functions - more on this soon).
                    <br /> <br />
                    These ideas about programming are more than enough on their own - you can do almost anything by making
                    variables and functions - but when it comes to large-scale projects like Minecraft it becomes 
                    far too complex too soon. 
                    <br /> <br />
                    Let's use Minecraft as an example to getting towards OOP
                    <br /> <br />
